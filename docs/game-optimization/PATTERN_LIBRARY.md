# Runtime optimization patterns

Reuse `tools/standalone_host/fmv/hook_guard.py`, `prepare.VirtualRom`, the existing native ARM9 PC sampler and graphics-replay tests. These entries are evidence and admission rules, not permission to patch another title automatically.

## Redundant graphics state within a primitive

Detector: repeated writes of the same value to a graphics register with only vertex/texture-coordinate submissions between them. Classify the complete dependency set first. Castlevania ACVE r0 writes NORMAL four times per background quad at `0x02004280`; its two static callers are `0x02003dfc` and `0x020041fc`.

Do not infer redundancy from equal command values alone. NORMAL also changes lighting and, in texture mode 2, texture coordinates. Matrices, materials, lights, active light masks and shininess are dependencies. Removing commands changes pipeline timing even when all pixels match. The three-NOP Castlevania trial passed 3,000 video frames but failed RAM/audio equivalence and was rejected.

Exact alternative tested and rejected for insufficient native gain: memoize the pure lighting calculation in the existing HPS interpreter while retaining each command, texture-coordinate side effect, pipeline update and cycle charge. Invalidate conservatively on every command outside the proven color/normal/texcoord/vertex whitelist, on reset and on GPU restore. This generalizes to games using the same graphics API without needing guest addresses.

## Repeated asset content is not unchanged content

Detector: decoded texture hashes that return to a small set of values. The cave backgrounds alternated between two actual palette results in a 25-input capture. A monotonic revision is safe for invalidation but cannot recognize a returning content state. A hash alone cannot authorize exact reuse: retain and compare the actual source bytes.

Reject unconditional palette-upload suppression. Precompute/cache only after matching all content and rendering dependencies. Include allocation, matching, copying, changing frames and dual-core synchronization in the cost model; repeated frozen frames alone are not an acceptance benchmark.

## Native waiting versus reference instruction counts

Reference instruction sampling identifies executed loops. Native PC sampling measures observed wall time, including halt/DMA periods. Neither is a cycle counter. For ACVE the first cave capture observed 37.2% halted samples; the native geometry stream already submitted about 60 frames/s while completed screen publications were about 21.3/s. Prioritize the limiting stage, not the largest reference loop by itself.

## Opaque draw order and hidden pixels

Detector: long runs of opaque, constant-depth, screen-aligned rectangles, interrupted by translucent effects or other ordering dependencies. A nearest-first order can let existing depth tests reject hidden shading, but can also turn a vectorized write into a slower scalar rejection. Measure on the target CPU.

An experimental conservative predicate requires unchanged color, rectangular corners, opaque supported texture formats, ordinary depth testing, and no fog/edge-marking/clear-image effects. Sort pointers, not large raster state objects; keep ties stable and preserve unsafe barriers. Test randomized depths, polygon IDs, equal-depth operations, AA state changes and the original scene replays. A four-pixel rejection is valid only when every source pixel is strictly farther and none has a live lower AA layer.

## Resident decoded variants

A returning palette state can reuse the already decoded texture in its original allocation. Record all source ranges at decode, including wrapped texture data, auxiliary compressed data and the palette. Compare the small palette first, then every relevant source byte. On a hit, restore the complete cache entry and its identity; on eviction, return storage through the original free list. Limit memory and preserve reset/remap semantics. This avoids decoding an image merely to discover that it matches a prior image.

## Sparse callback-table traversal is not idle polling

Detector: a bounded loop with a constant record stride, a nullable loaded function pointer and an indirect call, rather than a fixed MMIO address. In ACVE runtime RAM, `0x020126f4` and `0x020128e4` traverse 0x110 records with stride 0x2a0. The second loads `[r5]`, skips nulls and calls `blx r1`; the first also checks `[r5+4]` and flags at `[r5+0xc]`. These account for the two previously unresolved >2% native PC sample sites, but samples are not cycle shares.

An active-record index could reduce empty scans only if every registration, deletion and reordering operation is captured and callback order remains identical. Treat an object-update role as an inference until symbols or write watches establish it. Do not replace this with halt or skip callbacks. It is not the current throughput priority while geometry already runs near 60 submissions/sec.

## Branch-heavy halfword copy

Detector: an ARM loop compares a byte offset against a signed length, then uses
separate conditional/unconditional branch pairs around a halfword load, store
and offset increment. These branches all depend on the same comparison flags.
Flag the structure, not a title-specific address or an assumption that it is a
particular SDK function. FFTA2 A6FE r0 provides the first observed example.

Candidate: compact the control flow while retaining the exact halfword access
order, overlap behavior, signed/zero/odd-length handling, final registers and
NZCV flags. Prefer an in-place replacement with no extra memory. The generic
`tools/game_optimization/check_halfword_copy_patch.py` takes addresses and bytes
from a per-game manifest and compares synthetic machine states and data accesses.
The first candidate passed 1,276 synthetic cases but failed full-game replay:
16 of 4,400 top-screen frames, audio, and non-code RAM differ. It is rejected,
despite 1.565% fewer ARM9 instructions in the selected Luso window. Synthetic
instruction savings do not establish native cycles or whole-game equivalence.

`tools/game_optimization/scan_guest_patterns.py` implements a register-renaming
structural detector with exact branch destinations and load/store roles. It
finds this scaffold in both ARM9 and ARM7 code; shared SDK identity is not yet
proven. It scans ARM main/autoload sections only. An occurrence in data or
Thumb code can be a false positive; require execution evidence before using it.

Trace actual caller ranges before promotion. MMIO, DMA/interrupt interleavings,
code-overlap destinations, instruction visibility and timing-sensitive readers
are separate obligations. Never replace halfword accesses with wider accesses
or DMA based only on equal final bytes in ordinary RAM.

The observed callers include toon-table MMIO, VRAM and palette uploads as well
as ordinary RAM. Whole-replay divergence starts before the profiled battle
window. An optimization applied globally at boot must pass initialization and
other callers too. Matching every return value and data access in an isolated
function does not prove equivalent interrupt, DMA, audio or graphics timing.

## Polling that also transfers data

A backward branch on a busy bit is not sufficient evidence of an idle loop.
Check the full loop for data-ready tests, MMIO data reads, destination stores,
byte counts and completion behavior. FFTA2's observed cartridge receive loop
polls ROMCTRL and consumes words from the cartridge data register. A halt or
NOP shortcut would remove required work unless a separately proven existing
mechanism performs the same transfer. This detector should prevent unsafe
idle-loop suggestions in other games.

## Redundant bitfield shift chains

Detector: flag-preserving ARM `LSL d,s,8; ASR d,d,16; LSL d,d,16;
LSR d,d,16; LSL d,d,16`. The final word equals
`((s >> 8) & 0xffff) << 16`, so `LSR d,s,8; LSL d,d,16` preserves that
result. `scan_guest_patterns.py` recognizes the structure with register
renaming and rejects flag-setting variants and SP/PC operands. It found six
ARM9 occurrences in the first title; this is not proof of SDK provenance.

Compacting a surrounding block requires every incoming branch, internal back
edge, literal and live register to remain correct. In the FFTA2 experiment,
the entry jump targeted the original loop-test location and had to move with
the tail. Retain all memory accesses and verify complete block state, not
only the simplified expression. `check_guest_block_patch.py` reuses the
existing Unicorn runner with a declarative private fixture.

The first patch preserved 32 accesses per four-vertex block and passed 1,536
synthetic cases, reducing 112 instructions to 103. All 4,400 replay screen
pairs and save data matched, but audio and RAM did not; the patch is rejected
under the bit-exact budget. Smaller arithmetic changes still need full-game
timing validation. Native gain is unknown.

The longer routes subsequently exposed three changed bottom-screen frames
and larger audio differences. A small observed delta in one scene is not a
whole-game bound. Register/payload traces should compare complete operations
separately from their timestamps: the first Luso trace matched 549,874 paired
blocks, while 1,477 crossed different frame boundaries. Track unfinished and
unpaired tails explicitly; never truncate them silently to declare equality.

The existing replay oracle now supports declarative completed-block tracing
and optional private SPU-register tracing. `compare_event_traces.py` compares
ordered payloads without aligning away changed or missing commands. Matching
control writes alone does not establish equality of sample-buffer contents,
interrupt scheduling, mixed audio or native output.

In the longer FFTA2 route, all 3,286,148 block payloads/end states and 539,880
SPU-register payloads match. Yet 755 sound writes cross different mix-call
boundaries, mixed audio differs, and two single-scanline image differences
remain. This is evidence for separating work equivalence from scheduling and
sample-source equivalence. The next diagnostic should observe actual channel
sample reads, not infer unchanged audio data from unchanged source addresses.

That follow-up matched all 46,439,652 FIFO words and 371,300,720 paired decoded
steps by channel/note/ordinal. It retained 37 unmatched tail steps across 15
notes rather than silently aligning them away. The dominant waveform changes
came from two notes starting one mix callback later. Matching source words can
therefore coexist with a substantial pointwise waveform delta.

The generic sample observer records values already read/decoded; extra emulated
reads could change the behavior under investigation. Its comparator keeps
channel-start generations, ordered payloads, timing and unmatched tails
separate. The output explainer checks the existing non-interpolated SPU
arithmetic against recorded samples and control writes. A write observed after
callback k must not affect k retroactively. It explained every captured
channel-output record in both runs, without approving mixed-audio differences.
Always repeat golden-output stability after changing diagnostic instrumentation.

## Active audio-buffer replacement

Detector: sound fetches retain the same channel, start generation, source
address and mix index, but the fetched word changes. Compare neighboring
words against known asset content to locate a possible transition between old
and new contents. Then trace actual CPU/DMA writes, completion, ownership and
sound-channel stop/reuse order. Matching command payloads or addresses cannot
prove that the hardware read the same data.

The FFTA2 Luso route provides a concrete lead: three words in one four-word
fetch burst differ; surrounding data matches two contiguous cartridge
sequences across an apparent overwrite frontier. Those three words alter
1,182 decoded samples. The Fire route has exact source/decoded values and
only four control-timing output differences. Do not generalize one route's
timing bounds to another or classify changed decoded values as phase alone.
Even an exact mixer-output explanation can contain different source data.
No caching, delayed write or buffer-lifetime patch is authorized by this
pattern entry; the writer/dependency evidence must come first.

The follow-up observes main-RAM bus stores and sound fetches in one ordered
trace, using values already written/read. All 17,272 store payloads match and
all 9,959 fetches per arm agree with preceding stores. Three ARM9 cartridge
stores cross the fetch boundary while the channel remains enabled at low
volume. CPU instruction context plus a zero executing-DMA mask identifies
the writer; a sound event's incidental CPU PC alone would not. This is a
concrete example of identical producer work yielding different consumer data
because of ordering. Do not apply a source-data cache or move a transfer
without preserving ownership, completion and active-consumer dependencies.

## Temporary decoder outputs are not automatically dead work

A decoder can write intermediate buffers while sound hardware reads separate
looping buffers. The observed FFTA2 routine repeatedly consumes 128 bytes and
produces 512 bytes, but its output ranges have no direct SPU fetches in the
replay. Separate PCM16 playback rings are active. Follow CPU/ARM7 copies,
mixing and ownership before removing the routine or caching its output. An
empty direct-consumer intersection is a lead to investigate, not dead-code
proof. Preserve the predictor state as an input when considering reuse.

The follow-up traced original halfword copies from those staging buffers into
alternating halves of the active PCM rings. All 15,392 observed copied values
matched preceding staging stores, and all 12,448 captured sound reads matched
preceding writes. The watch covered only the first 16 bytes of each buffer
half: it proves this dependency, not complete content recurrence or safe removal.

## Scaled nibble-decoder step arithmetic

Detector: `ASR accumulator,step,#3`, followed by unrotated immediate tests of
nibble bits 4, 2 and 1 and conditional additions of `step`, `step ASR 1` and
`step ASR 2`. The generic scanner allows register renaming and rejects shifted
or rotated tests, changed conditions, flag-setting additions and SP/PC operands.
It found one hot ARM9 occurrence in FFTA2; no SDK identity is established.

For positive step values divisible by 8, with `15*step` fitting signed 32 bits,
the sum equals `(step + 2*step*(nibble & 7)) >> 3`. Prove every table entry,
valid entry indices, overflow/rounding and flags before replacing it. The
removed tests preserve C/V only for unrotated immediates; N/Z must be overwritten
before use. Do not infer that from printed disassembly alone. Verify the entire
function's live state, all branch/literal relocations and ordered accesses.

Declare literal/table bytes as manifest `data_guards`. The existing virtual
loader checks them against the original and combined patched image. This is
not runtime enforcement: separately watch table writes and entry contracts
through each replay, with all instrumentation limits retained. The first
Luso route had no post-initialization table writes and 12,456 valid entries.

FFTA2's same-size arithmetic candidate passed 4,885 synthetic cases and reduced
the selected battle instruction count by 2.512%, with exact screens and saves.
RAM/audio still differ. It remains disabled: local arithmetic equivalence and
fewer instructions do not establish scheduling safety or native performance.

The next battle route expands the failure: 1,892 bottom-screen frames differ
and audio reaches opposite clipping limits. Most changed images match a
neighboring control frame, but 376 have no identical hash within three frames.
Retain same-frame failures and unmatched results rather than aligning them
away. A small first-route audio bound must not become a game-wide allowance;
observe actual source words, decoded samples and sound-control timing before
classifying the cause. The retained control can be reused only with pinned
trace provenance and matching semantic outputs for the current oracle.

The Fire follow-up matches all fetched source words and decoded values without
unmatched tails. Fourteen note starts move, and control timing shifts by up to
682 mixer callbacks, about 21 ms. The recorded samples/controls exactly explain
all channel outputs, including the large pointwise waveform differences.
Distinguish this measured timing effect from data corruption and from audibility;
the explanation still does not authorize a non-bit-exact patch.

The shorter route instead exposes three changed source words at an active
sound-buffer overwrite boundary. A separate trace for this candidate matches
all producer write payloads but moves three stores before the consumer read;
the unchanged data arrives earlier. This reproduces the dependency class
seen with the vertex patch, with a different timestamp delta. Confirm each
candidate's actual ordering instead of transferring another patch's bounds.
Preserve both cases: identical-source scheduling shifts and changed-source
interleaving need different evidence and must not share an assumed tolerance.

## Elapsed-time accounting is not removable debug work

Detector: a hardware-timer read with overflow accounting, storage of a previous
tick, accumulation of the delta and downstream counter updates. Follow the
consumers before labeling a changing RAM word harmless. The observed FFTA2
fields feed a 60/60/1000-limited counter. They are live accounting data, not
patch scratch. Equal images/saves do not authorize masking them or accepting
unclassified audio differences.
